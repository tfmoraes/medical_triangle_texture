# Isosurface rendering of medical images improved by automatic texture mapping

Advances in medical imaging modalities have allowed the acquisition of large collections of volumetric
images for clinical and training purposes, such as Computerized Tomography, Magnetic Resonance
Imaging, Mammography, Fluoroscopy, X-Ray Microtomography, Positron Emission Tomography and
Ultrasonography. Volume rendering has proved to be a very ﬂexible and eﬀective technique for exploring
and visualizing such massive medical data sets. Realistic models of complex human anatomical structures
can be constructed and manipulated by medical professionals to enhance internal structures of interest.
This work proposes and evaluates a novel isosurface rendering method for medical images improved by
automatic texture mapping. The texture information is generated through diﬀerent volume projection
approaches. Experiments conducted on several data sets demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of the proposed
rendering method.
